# Tmux Configuration Enhancement Project Debrief

**Date:** 2025-08-19  
**Goal:** Fix tmux annoyances and optimize configuration for better workflow

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Catppuccin Theme Window Renaming Issue
**Problem:** Catppuccin theme was preventing window renaming from working
**Solution:** Added `set -g @catppuccin_window_status "no"` to disable theme's window formatting
**Why:** Allows custom window names while keeping the beautiful theme for status bar

### 2. Created Enhanced Cheatsheet System
**What:** Built comprehensive popup cheatsheet with beautiful ASCII box formatting
**Keybindings:**
- `Ctrl+a ?` or `Ctrl+a C` → Instant 80x25 popup window with all commands
- Symlinked to home directory for easy access

**Why:** Perfect for learning tmux commands without context switching to browser/docs

### 3. Implemented Convenient Prefix Shortcuts *(Updated)*
**Concept:** Use reliable prefix-based shortcuts for common actions
**Bindings:**
- `Ctrl+a c` → New window in current directory
- `Ctrl+a C` → Instant help popup  
- `Ctrl+a s` → Save session manually (habit building!)
- `Ctrl+a d` → Detach session (don't kill everything!)

**Strategic Value:** Reliable keybindings that build good tmux habits
**Note:** Originally implemented F19 bindings but replaced with standard prefix shortcuts for better compatibility

### 4. Quality-of-Life Config Improvements
- **Windows/panes start at 1** (not 0) - more intuitive
- **`Ctrl+a r`** - Quick config reload
- **Alt+1-5** - Rapid window switching without prefix
- **Better terminal titles** and rename handling
- **Kept intuitive split keys** (`Ctrl+a |` and `Ctrl+a -`)

## Strategic Thinking Behind Choices

### Key Binding Strategy *(Updated)*
**Original request:** Use CapsLock for splits or common actions
**Evolution:** Started with F19 (CapsLock) bindings, then moved to reliable prefix shortcuts
**Reasoning:** F19 bindings caused "unknown key" errors; prefix bindings are more reliable and portable

### Session Management Focus
**Problem:** User was treating tmux like disposable terminals
**Solution:** Make session save/detach incredibly convenient via prefix shortcuts
**Goal:** Transform workflow from "kill everything" to "persistent workspaces"

### Learning-Focused Design
- Instant help popup encourages exploration
- Manual save binding (`Ctrl+a s`) builds awareness of session persistence  
- Detach binding (`Ctrl+a d`) breaks destructive "kill session" habit
- Cheatsheet includes progression from basic to advanced usage

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `.tmux.conf` - Main configuration with all enhancements
- `.tmux-cheatsheet.txt` - Comprehensive command reference
- Symlink created: `~/.tmux-cheatsheet.txt` → dotfiles version

### Key Technical Decisions *(Updated)*
1. **Switched from F19 to prefix bindings** - Better compatibility across terminals
2. **Popup dimensions 80x25** - Optimal for cheatsheet readability
3. **Fallback paths** - Cheatsheet works from home dir or dotfiles location
4. **Preserved existing keybindings** - Enhanced rather than replaced user's workflow

## Session Management Education Provided

### What Resurrect/Continuum Actually Save
- Window/pane layouts and positions
- Working directories for each pane
- Running programs (bash, vim, etc.)
- Vim/Neovim sessions with open files
- Pane contents (last ~2000 lines)

### Key Concept: "Hibernate for Development Environment"
- Not Git-like snapshots, but complete workspace preservation
- Auto-saves every 15 minutes
- Manual saves before risky operations
- Restore with `tmux a` + `Ctrl+a Ctrl+r`

## Future Growth Path Outlined

### Advanced Tools Explained (For Later)
- **FZF/Telescope/Sessionizer** - "Google search for filesystem"
- **Real-time fuzzy finding** across entire codebases
- **Project session management** - instant switching between work contexts
- **Integration points** - When user masters basic tmux, these become superpowers

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Fixed immediate annoyances (window renaming)
- ✅ Created learning-friendly help system
- ✅ Built habit-forming convenience features
- ✅ Preserved user's preferred keybindings
- ✅ Established foundation for advanced workflow growth

## Commands to Remember *(Updated)*
```bash
# Apply changes
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
# Or use new binding: Ctrl+a r

# Test new features (all require Ctrl+a prefix)
Ctrl+a C             # Help popup
Ctrl+a s             # Save session  
Ctrl+a d             # Detach cleanly
Ctrl+a c             # New window in current path
```

## Context for Future Claude Sessions *(Updated)*
- User is tmux beginner but learning fast
- Moved from F19 bindings to reliable prefix shortcuts for better compatibility
- Prefers building good habits over quick fixes
- Values intuitive keybindings (like | and - for splits)
- Ready to graduate to advanced tools (FZF/telescope) once tmux basics are solid
- Working in homelab infrastructure context
- Install script now handles complete automated setup including TPM
