# Hotkey Functionality - Revised for Work Computer

## TL;DR - You Were Right

Since you already have **Keyboard Maestro** and **Alfred PowerPack** approved and running with Accessibility permissions on your work computer, there's no additional security concern with adding hotkey functionality via these tools.

**Recommendation: Use Keyboard Maestro** (most powerful, already approved, 5-minute setup)

---

## What Changed

### My Initial Assessment
‚ùå "Hammerspoon requires Accessibility permissions, which is a security risk"

### Reality
‚úÖ You already have Keyboard Maestro and Alfred with the same permissions
‚úÖ These are commercial, approved tools
‚úÖ No additional risk from adding dev launcher hotkeys
‚úÖ Our implementation doesn't do keylogging, screen capture, or anything sketchy

### Conclusion
**There's no security reason to avoid hotkey functionality on your work computer.**

## Your Three Options (All Work-Safe)

### Option 1: Keyboard Maestro ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Why this is best:**
- Already installed and approved
- Most powerful and flexible
- Visual editor (easy to audit)
- Can show native menus
- Professional tool

**Setup:** 5 minutes
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
# Choose option 1: Keyboard Maestro
```

Or follow: `environment-launcher/keyboard-maestro-setup.md`

---

### Option 2: Alfred PowerPack

**Why this is good:**
- Already installed and approved
- Beautiful UI
- Can use keyword triggers (type `dev`)
- Great integration with other Alfred features

**Setup:** 5 minutes
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
# Choose option 2: Alfred
```

Or follow: `environment-launcher/alfred-setup.md`

---

### Option 3: Hammerspoon

**Why this is still valid:**
- No worse than KM/Alfred security-wise
- Free and open source
- Already in your dotfiles
- Good for version control

**Setup:** 2 minutes
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
# Choose option 3: Hammerspoon
```

Or:
```bash
cp environment-launcher/hammerspoon-work-safe.lua ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua
open -a Hammerspoon
```

## What You Get

Regardless of which tool you choose, the functionality is identical:

**‚åò+Shift+D** ‚Üí Opens interactive dev environment menu
- Select from NixOS, K3s, Python, Node, Rust containers
- Launch Parallels VMs
- Clean development environments

**‚åò+Shift+C** ‚Üí Docker cleanup (optional)

**Type `dev`** ‚Üí Same menu (if using Alfred)

---

## Hammerspoon Guardrails (Option 3)

If you choose Hammerspoon, the work-safe config includes:

**What it does:**
- Binds hotkeys to launch terminal scripts
- Shows notifications
- That's it.

**What it does NOT do:**
- ‚ùå No keylogging
- ‚ùå No screen capture
- ‚ùå No clipboard monitoring
- ‚ùå No file monitoring
- ‚ùå No network access
- ‚ùå No window management
- ‚ùå No automatic actions

**Audit-friendly:**
- 100 lines of commented Lua
- Single-purpose configuration
- Easy to review
- Optional audit log

**Config file:** `environment-launcher/hammerspoon-work-safe.lua`

---

## Security Summary (All Three Options)

### Permissions Required

All three tools need the same macOS permissions:
- ‚úÖ Accessibility (monitor input for hotkeys)
- ‚úÖ Automation (execute shell scripts)

**You already granted these to Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.**

### Our Implementation

All three implementations are minimal and auditable:
- Only execute when YOU press a hotkey
- Launch scripts in terminal (visible to you)
- No background monitoring or logging
- No access to sensitive data

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Keyboard Maestro | Alfred | Hammerspoon |
|------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| Keylogging | Could, but doesn't | Could, but doesn't | Could, but doesn't |
| Screen capture | Could, but doesn't | Could, but doesn't | Could, but doesn't |
| Actual behavior | Launches terminal scripts | Launches terminal scripts | Launches terminal scripts |
| Commercial support | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Community |
| IT approval | ‚úÖ Already approved | ‚úÖ Already approved | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not prohibited |

**Bottom line:** All three are equally safe for your use case.

## My Specific Recommendation

Based on your situation:
- Work computer with sensitive data
- Already have KM and Alfred approved
- Want hotkey functionality
- Want to maintain dotfiles

**Use Keyboard Maestro:**

1. **Most powerful** - Can do anything you might want later
2. **Already approved** - IT won't question it
3. **Visual editor** - Easy to show others what it does
4. **Professional** - Built for business use
5. **Best UX** - Native menus, notifications, dialogs

**Setup:**
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
# Choose Keyboard Maestro
# Follow 5-minute visual setup
```

**Alternative: Use Alfred if:**
- You prefer keyword access (`dev` in Alfred bar)
- You want tighter integration with Alfred features
- You like Alfred's UI better

**Fallback: Use Hammerspoon if:**
- You want everything in version control
- You want identical setup on personal computer
- You prefer code-based configuration

---

## Quick Start

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
```

This script:
1. Detects which tools you have installed
2. Offers to configure your preferred tool
3. Provides step-by-step instructions
4. Opens relevant documentation

### Manual Setup

**Keyboard Maestro:**
```bash
# Read setup guide
cat environment-launcher/keyboard-maestro-setup.md
# Or open in editor
open environment-launcher/keyboard-maestro-setup.md
```

**Alfred:**
```bash
# Read setup guide
cat environment-launcher/alfred-setup.md
# Or open in editor
open environment-launcher/alfred-setup.md
```

**Hammerspoon:**
```bash
# Copy work-safe config
mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon
cp environment-launcher/hammerspoon-work-safe.lua ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua

# Launch Hammerspoon
open -a Hammerspoon

# Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted
```

---

## Testing

After setup, test with:

1. **Press ‚åò+Shift+D** ‚Üí Should open dev environment menu
2. **Select an environment** ‚Üí Should launch container/VM
3. **Exit** ‚Üí Environment closed

If it doesn't work:
- Check Accessibility permissions in System Settings
- Verify `~/.local/bin/dev-launcher` exists and is executable
- Check console output for errors

---

## What About install-work.sh?

The `install-work.sh` script is still valid for situations where:
- You want to test without hotkeys first
- You're on a locked-down corporate machine
- You prefer typing `dev` over pressing hotkeys

**But for your laptop:** Since you already have approved automation tools, there's no reason not to use hotkeys.

2. **Run setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
   ```

3. **Test it:**
   - Press ‚åò+Shift+D
   - Select an environment
   - Verify it works

4. **Use it:**
   - ‚åò+Shift+D whenever you want a dev environment
   - All the productivity, none of the security concerns

---

## Questions for IT (If They Ask)

**Q: What permissions does this need?**
A: Same as Keyboard Maestro and Alfred (already approved) - Accessibility and Automation.

**Q: What does it do?**
A: Binds ‚åò+Shift+D to open a menu for launching isolated Docker containers and VMs for development.

**Q: Does it log keystrokes or capture the screen?**
A: No. It only executes when I press the hotkey, and it just launches terminal scripts.

**Q: Can I audit it?**
A: Yes. [Show them the Keyboard Maestro macro, Alfred workflow, or Hammerspoon Lua file]

**Q: Why do you need this?**
A: For quickly launching isolated development environments without affecting the main system. Increases security through containerization.

---

## Final Word

You were absolutely right to push back on my initial caution. Since you already have professional automation tools approved and running, there's no reason to avoid hotkey functionality.

**Go set up Keyboard Maestro and enjoy your ‚åò+Shift+D hotkey!** üöÄ
