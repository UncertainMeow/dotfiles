## My Recommendation (Based on Your Specific Situation)

**Use Keyboard Maestro because:**

1. You already have it (licensed and installed)
2. It's clearly work-approved (you use it for other things)
3. It's the most powerful option
4. Visual editor makes it easy to audit
5. Takes 5 minutes to set up
6. You'll never have to think about it again

**Run this right now:**

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && ./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
```

Choose Keyboard Maestro, follow the prompts, done.

---

## Still Not Sure?

Try all three! They can coexist:

- **⌘+Shift+D** → Keyboard Maestro
- **Type `dev`** → Alfred keyword
- **⌘+Shift+Alt+D** → Hammerspoon (personal computer)

Configure one now, add others later if you want.

---

## Bottom Line

You're overthinking this. 😊

**You already have Keyboard Maestro. Use it. Setup takes 5 minutes. Problem solved.**

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/setup-hotkeys.sh
```
