# Configuration Fixes Applied - Oct 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ghostty Theme Not Found
**Problem:** Ghostty config referenced `theme = "catppuccin-mocha"` but the theme file didn't exist in `~/.config/ghostty/themes/`

**Solution:**
- Downloaded the catppuccin-mocha theme from the official Catppuccin Ghostty repository
- Created validation script `scripts/validate-ghostty-themes.sh` that automatically downloads missing themes
- Integrated validation into `install.sh` to prevent this issue on fresh installs

### 2. Zsh Parse Error - mkcd Function
**Problem:** `mkcd` was defined as both an alias (in `aliases.zsh`) and a function (in `functions.zsh`), causing the error:
```
defining function based on alias `mkcd'
parse error near `()'
```

**Solution:**
- Removed the alias definition from `aliases.zsh` (the function version has better error handling)
- Added `mkcd` to the `unalias` command in `functions.zsh` to explicitly prevent conflicts
- Created validation script `scripts/validate-zsh-config.sh` to detect these conflicts automatically

## What Caused These Issues

1. **Ghostty theme:** The theme file wasn't included in the initial setup, and there was no validation to ensure it existed before Ghostty tried to load it.

2. **mkcd conflict:** The dotfiles were modularly designed, but aliases and functions were split into separate files without checks for naming conflicts between them.

## Preventive Measures Added

### New Validation Scripts

1. **`scripts/validate-ghostty-themes.sh`**
   - Checks if referenced themes exist
   - Auto-downloads Catppuccin themes if missing
   - Provides helpful error messages for unknown themes

2. **`scripts/validate-zsh-config.sh`**
   - Detects alias/function name conflicts
   - Tests zsh syntax of all config files
   - Warns about common mistakes (like using parameters in aliases)

### Updated Installation Process

The `install.sh` script now automatically runs both validation scripts during installation to catch issues before they cause problems.

### Improved Functions File

Added explicit unalias for all functions that might conflict with common alias names, preventing the parse error from occurring even if the alias file is modified.

## Other Potential Issues Addressed

The validation scripts also check for:
- Invalid zsh syntax across all config files
- Parameters used in aliases (which don't work - should be functions)
- Missing directories or files that configs reference

## How to Use the Validation Scripts

Run manually at any time:
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./scripts/validate-ghostty-themes.sh
./scripts/validate-zsh-config.sh
```

Or run them automatically by reinstalling:
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Files Modified

- `~/.config/ghostty/themes/catppuccin-mocha` - Created (downloaded theme)
- `~/dotfiles-config/zsh/aliases.zsh` - Removed mkcd alias
- `~/dotfiles/config/zsh/aliases.zsh` - Removed mkcd alias
- `~/dotfiles-config/zsh/functions.zsh` - Added mkcd to unalias, cleaned up header
- `~/dotfiles/config/zsh/functions.zsh` - Added mkcd to unalias, cleaned up header
- `~/dotfiles/install.sh` - Added validation steps
- `~/dotfiles/scripts/validate-ghostty-themes.sh` - New validation script
- `~/dotfiles/scripts/validate-zsh-config.sh` - New validation script
- `~/dotfiles/README.md` - Added troubleshooting and maintenance documentation

## Testing

Both validation scripts have been tested and confirm:
- ✅ Ghostty theme configuration is valid
- ✅ No alias/function conflicts
- ✅ All zsh files have valid syntax
- ✅ No common configuration mistakes detected

You can now open a new Ghostty terminal without errors!
